# Data-Science-Machine-Learning-practice-activities

Here are some activities that I'm doing to practice Data Science, and Machine Learning

Plant_Stress.ipynb is where I compared two models that are CNN-SVM hybrid, and CNN with softmax as its classification layer to classify soybean stresses from RGB images of soybean leaves images.

pneumonia_detection.ipynb is where I compared a CNN model from the scratch to pretrained models to detect pneumonia.

I will still add more activities here, and improve this repository soon!
